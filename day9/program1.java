You are developing a math learning application that includes a 
feature to help students identify and understand special numbers.

A special number is defined as a positive integer with m digits, 
that equals the sum of its digits, each raised to the power of m.
To determine if a number is special:
Calculate the number of digits m.
Compute the sum of each digit raised to the power of m.
Check if this sum equals the original number.

Explanation:

Number: 153

It has 3 digits (m=3)

Sum of Digits Raised to the Power of m:
=1^3+5^3+3^3
=1+125+27=>153
=153=153
